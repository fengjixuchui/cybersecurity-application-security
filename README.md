# Application Security
> An ongoing & curated collection of awesome  software practices and remediation, libraries and frameworks,payloads and techniques, best guidelines and technical resources about Application Security.


## Introduction

> A Web application (Web app) is an application program that is stored on a remote server and delivered over the Internet through a browser interface. […] Web applications do not need to be downloaded since they are accessed through a network. Users can access a Web application through a web browser such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox or Safari. For a web app to operate, it needs a Web server, application server, and a database. Web servers manage the requests that come from a client, while the application server completes the requested task. A database can be used to store any needed information.


### Among the benefits of web applications we list:
#### A. EASIER INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE 
It’s much easier to install, upgrade or maintain a web-based application than a standalone desktop application. Web applications are upgraded in the host servers, and every user can access the updated version as soon as the deployment had finished, without needing to update the application on their PCs. 

#### B. NO DOWNLOAD HASSLES
From an end-user perspective, this is probably the greatest advantage – with web applications, you don’t have to download anything in order to use the service. A compatible browser with Internet access is usually all you need. 

#### C. USE OF LESS STORAGE SPACE 
When using a web application, you don’t have to worry about how much space and memory it needs on your device. Moreover, they can be accessed from any place in the world where there is an active Internet connection. 

#### D. ACCESSIBLE ON VARIOUS PLATFORMS  
It’s safe to say that nowadays mobility is a great asset and it sure helps a lot not to depend on a certain device in order to complete your tasks. Web applications can be used on any platform (desktop, laptop, phone, tablet), wherever you are. 


### Web applications may be: 
#### A. STATIC WEB APPLICATIONS 
These are the most basic type of web application, created using HTML and CSS. If you need to make any serious changes to it, it’s highly certain that you need to contact the ones who planned and designed it. 

#### B. DYNAMIC WEB APPLICATIONS 
Dynamic web applications can include databases or forums and have the constant ability to update or change the available information. 

#### C. E-COMMERCE APPLICATIONS
E-commerce apps are more complex than the other two mentioned before, since they need a way to collect electronic payment. 

#### D. PORTAL WEB APPLICATIONS 
Portal web applications include forums, chats, emails etc. and are characterized by many different sections or categories which are accessible by way of a home page. 

#### E. ANIMATED WEB APPLICATIONS 
It’s mandatory for this kind of applications to use FLASH technology. Animated web applications do not work with SEO optimization or positioning, because search engines cannot read their information properly. 

#### F. CONTENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS 
Content management systems offer interfaces that can be accessed and updated and are used for personal or corporate blogs, media sites and so on.  If we want to talk about web application security, though, we must first specify that web applications are related to the supply chain topic, which we covered here. Unfortunately but not surprisingly, as third-parties in your business workflow, web applications can be attacked in various ways, from database manipulation to large-scale network disruption.  According to DARKReading, 


## What is web application security?
- Web application security is the process of protecting websites and online services against different security threats that exploit vulnerabilities in an application’s code. Common targets for web application attacks are content management systems (e.g., WordPress), database administration tools (e.g., phpMyAdmin) and SaaS applications.
