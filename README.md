## What is web application security?
- Web application security is the process of protecting websites and online services against different security threats that exploit vulnerabilities in an application’s code. Common targets for web application attacks are content management systems (e.g., WordPress), database administration tools (e.g., phpMyAdmin) and SaaS applications.

### Perpetrators consider web applications high-priority targets due to:

- The inherent complexity of their source code, which increases the likelihood of unattended vulnerabilities and malicious code manipulation.
- High value rewards, including sensitive private data collected from successful source code manipulation.
- Ease of execution, as most attacks can be easily automated and launched indiscriminately against thousands, or even tens or hundreds of thousands of targets at a time.


Organizations failing to secure their web applications run the risk of being attacked. Among other consequences, this can result in information theft, damaged client relationships, revoked licenses and legal proceedings.

### How does application security testing reduce your organization’s risk?

#### Majority of Web Application Attacks
